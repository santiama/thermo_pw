SUBROUTINE adjust_tau(tau_save, tau, at)
!
!  This routine receives as input the crystal coordinates of the atoms in the
!  original cell and transforms them in cartesian coordinates with the new
!  at. This correspond to a uniform strain of the atomic coordinates
!  that should be already in units of the new celldm
