This is the distribution of the thermo_pw package. This program is
a driver to compute the physical properties of materials, using 
Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) (see http://www.quantum-espresso.org) routines 
as the underlying engine.

Thermo_pw reads the same input as the pw.x code of QE and produces postscript 
figures of some material properties. While less flexible than QE, 
for properties such as the electronic band structures, the phonon 
dispersions, or the harmonic and anharmonic thermodynamic quantities, 
it is simpler to use and faster to learn. Moreover it can run in parallel 
creating several images of itself, carrying out asynchronous tasks.
See Doc/tutorial.pdf for an overview of the possibilities of the code
and the file Doc/user_guide.pdf for a detailed description of all its options. 

Quick installation instructions:

Put this directory inside the main Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) directory.
Enter here and type 

make join_qe

Go again in the main QE directory and type

./configure
make thermo_pw

Now you should have the file thermo_pw.x in the QE/bin directory and
you can run the examples.

Complete installation instructions and short description of the
functionalities: See the Doc/user_guide.pdf.

Uninstal:
Enter in this directory and type
make leave_qe
Then remove this directory.

NB: This code substitutes the main Makefile, and the files install/makedeps.sh 
and install/plugins_makefile of the QE distribution. Only after typing 
make leave_qe the original files are copied in the QE distribution. If
you just remove the thermo_pw directory the files of QE package remain 
modified.
