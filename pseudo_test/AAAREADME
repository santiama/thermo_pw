This directory contains a set of scripts to test a set of pseudopotentials.
Presently it tests the files of pslibrary.1.0.0 with low accuracy.
The pseudopotential tests can be done with the following procedure.
The directory that contains this file is called $TOP_DIR. 
You are not supposed to modify any file here.
Choose a working directory ($WORK_DIR) and copy there the four
files:

environment.job 
lattice_constants_inputs.job
run_lc.job
exctract_lc.job

Edit only the file environment.job and choose the parameters of the run,
cut-off energies, k points, smearing etc.. Be careful to set the four
main directories here:
TOP_DIR : this directory,
WORK_DIR : your working directory where output files are written,
PSEUDO_DIR : the directory with the pseudopotentials,
TMP_DIR: the outdir directory used as scratch by thermo_pw.
Set here also the command used to run thermo_pw.
Generate all the inputs giving the command
. ./lattice_constants_input.job 
in your working directory $WORK_DIR.
Run all the inputs by giving the command:
. ./run_lc.job 
in your working directory $WORK_DIR.
Extract the lattice constants and bulk moduli of all the computed solids
by giving the command:
. ./extract_lc.job.

The example produces also the band structure of each solid inside each
solid directory in the postscript file output_band.ps.

In order to run a subsets of the input or a single solid edit the file
run_lc.job.
