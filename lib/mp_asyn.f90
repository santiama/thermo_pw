MODULE mp_asyn
!
!  This module gives to the calling program the functionality of  
!  master and workers. The master initializes the variables of the module 
!  saying how many processors there are (nproc),
!  how much work (nwork) has to be done, which mpi communicator is used 
!  between master and workers, and an array proc_num(0:nworkers) that 
!  for the master (0) and for all the workers (1:nworkers) gives the 
!  number of the processor within the communicator. 
!  The typical use of this module is inter images asynchronous
!  communication. The images can divide the total work into nwork
!  pieces and carry it out asynchronously. The images should not 
!  communicate with each other: only intra-image communications are allowed
!  because in general images run asynchronously. They can however 
!  syncronize the work using this module, that tells to the representative 
!  of each image which is the task that the image has to carry out. 
!
!  The master calls once asyn_init, and as often as possible asyn_master.
!  The master calls also asyn_close when the work is finished.
!  The workers call asyn_worker when they need some work to do and
!  wait until the master answers. The master can call asyn_master_work 
!  to ask for same work to do. 
! 
!  If the code is running after a serial compilation the routines of this
!  module should not be called.
