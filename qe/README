This directory contains few routines of Quantum ESPRESSO that need to
be modified to be used in thermo_pw.

Presently they are:

electrons_tpw: contains a call to asyn_master to have the master check for
                 slaves that need further work at each electron iteration.

solve_linter_tpw: contains a call to asyn_master to have the master check for
                 slaves that need further work at each phonon iteration.

phqscf_tpw : call solve_linter_tpw instead of solve_linter

prepare_q_tpw: use the variable tcollect_all to avoid the calculation of
the bands in the final run that collects all the dynamical matrices.

run_nscf_tpw : call set_small_group_q also in the lgamma_iq case. This change
               can probably be done also in the phonon, but it is tested here
               before changing qe. Set lscf to .false. because thermo_pw
               reads the input of pw that sets lscf or can do a scf calculation
               that sets this variable.

do_phonon_tpw : call phqscf_tpw instead of phqscf and prepare_q_tpw instead
            of prepare_q.

phescf_tpw : call the more general routine solve_e_fpolc in the case of finite
             frequency instead of solve_e_fpol.

ccg_psi_tpw : uses the new conventions for the noncollinear case.

phq_summary_tpw : summarize the frequencies in complex form

initialize_ph_tpw.f90 : calls the new routine phq_summary_tpw

adddvepsi_us_tpw.f90 : added the number of occupated bands as an input.

ev_xml : is identical to the QE routine, but it is copied here because files
         in the PW/tools directory are not linked to thermo_pw.

read_dyn_from_file : in the routine of PH there is an implicit dependence
         on first. The routine makes two different things if it is called
         for the first time. Since thermo_pw calls this routine for several
         geometry, the first file of each geometry should be considered as
         first. Removed the dependence on first.

usnldiagq.f90 generalizes usnldiag.f90. It computes the diagonal elements 
              of the Hamiltonian at k+q (except the kinetic energy).

This directory contains also some routines that are new, or generalize
those of QE. They are still experimental.

solve_e_fpolc.f90 : equivalent of solve_e, but computes the +w and -w
                    frequencies. Used to compute the complex
                    macroscopic dielectric constant at finite frequency.

apply_ac.f90
Apply H-eS-wS+a_c Q to a generic function, with the new conventions
required by the linear solvers. The c indicates a non Hermitian matrix 
(used when omega /=0 is complex).

scal_prod.f90 Makes the scalar products between wavefunctions.
Nedeed by the linear solver routines.

polarizc.f90     ! computes the complex polarizability and writes it on
                 ! output.

pheqscf.f90      ! compute the susceptibility at finite q and frequency.


set_intq_nc.f90        !
compute_intq.f90       !  These routines compute the integral of the 
transform_intq_nc.f90  !  augmentation function and e^iqr for the study of
transform_intq_so.f90  !  EELS with US PPs or PAW
                       !

solve_eq.f90      : This routine computes the charge-charge susceptibility
                    at finite q and frequency and the inverse of the
                    dielectric constant.

orthogonalize_omega.f90 : generalize orthogonalize for the case of
                          metals at finite frequency w when the alpha_pv 
                          term is included.

paw_add_symmetry.f90   : symmetrize the PAW term in the case of a e^iqr
                         perturbation.

dveqpsi_us.f90       ! computes e^iqr |psi_n>
dveqpsi_us_only.f90  ! computes the US contribution to e^iqr K |psi_kn>

addusddenseq.f90   ! add the augmentation charge in the case of a single
                   ! e^iqr perturbation.

psyme_fpol.f90     ! parallel driver of the following
syme_fpol.f90      ! similar to syme.f90, but used in the optical case
                   ! does not assume that the potential is real.

psymeq.f90         ! parallel driver of the following
symeq.f90          ! similar to syme_fpol.f90, but used for EELS and
                   ! symmetrize only one susceptibility.

psym_dmage_fpol.f90 ! parallel driver of the following
sym_dmage_fpol.f90  ! similar to sym_dmag.f90, but used in the optical case
                      does not assume that the potential is real.

psym_dmageq.f90   ! parallel driver of the following
sym_dmageq.f90    ! similar to sym_dmage.f90, but used for EELS and only
                    one perturbation is made.
