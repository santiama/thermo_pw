The A1 structure has the face centered cubic Bravais lattice and one
atom per cell.

The reference directory contains the following files: 

asy_tmp.asy : asymptote script to plot the Brillouin zone  

output_bands.ps : plot of the band structure

output_disp.ps.g1 : plot of the phonon dispersion. Note that the 
       experimental data are read by modifying the file gnuplot.tmp.g1_disp

output_anhar.ps : plot of the anharmonic quantities.

output_murn.ps: a plot of the energy as a function of the volume at T=0
                and a Murnaghan fit. Pressure as a function of volume.

al.scf.out: The output of the calculation of the equilibrium volume at T=0.

al.el_const.out : an example of the output of the elastic constants run.
